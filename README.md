- 👋 Hi, I’m @aknownunknown and 37 years old. The last code I wrote was simple stuff in Fortran back in a 2002 introductory class for my never completed MAE degree. I followed that college path for 2.5 years before graduating with a bachelor's in Biological Science focused on Pre-Medical/Dental. Never did post graduate work, but just shy of 15 years after graduation I sold my commercial office furniture dealership that I started in 2013. I'm now ready to go back and pursue my true passion of science, engineering and technology. Long story, but ask me and I may tell you.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything and everything as I always want to expand my horizons on all subjects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing related to coding but want to learn what I should be learning if I go back to school to finish an engineering or computer science degree. Unrelated to coding I'm trying to become fluent in Spanish which currently sits at maybe 40% proficiency on a good day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting which could be anything as I find interest in anyone and anything new to me. I may not be much help, but I learn fast and alway have an outside perspective.
- 📫 How to reach me should be left to this site unless I reach out otherwise.

I'm ready to learn something!
